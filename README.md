# Smart Wardrobe Experiment

A flutter/dart project which aims to simulate a smart wardrobe distributed system. 

## Getting Started
Please see V5 for my final solution which introduced a class system for users to exchange/ sell / donate and dispose of clothes.
Main contains my 1st attempt where users can just exchange clothes.
